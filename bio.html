                           Estonian native with Russian and Ukrainian heritage, Juri Krutii moved to Scotland 
                           in 2011 to study Film & Visual Culture at University of Aberdeen. After graduating 
                           Juri has taken an opportunity to work at University of Aberdeen as a teaching 
                           assistant, providing technical assistance to students on film courses. Having made 
                           a series of experimental works of his own, he continued to pursue his career as an 
                           aspiring filmmaker at Edinburgh’s Screen Academy Scotland, where he graduated from 
                           in 2018 with a degree of Master of Fine Arts in Advanced Film Practice. Driven by 
                           film theory and its application into practice, Juri aims to make works that are 
                           thought provoking, challenging in its structure and rely on a visual language 
                           to establish communication with the viewer. As a believer in the collaborative 
                           essence of filmmaking he has also worked as an Assistant Director on multiple short 
                           films, helping Directors structure their vision. Juri’s latest directorial work, 
                           Eudaimonia premiered at Glasgow Short Film Festival in 2018 as well as made its 
                           appearance at Inverness and Underwire Film Festivals the same year.
